==========

Solario is a Rails app that helps you decide if it is economical or not to install photovoltaic panels on your roof. Solario is currently an alpha release and only shows the annual output of any solar (photovoltaic) panels in Australia via a 3-D graph using dummy data. At present, the intention is to release alpha code only.
You can try it out [here](http://thawing-beach-7608.herokuapp.com).  

Roadmap
-------

The goal of Solario is to inform you of the various financial costs and benefits of installing photovoltaic panels. Ultimately, an impartial cost-benefit analysis is to be generated by using [Bureau of Meteorology data](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/how/newproducts/IDCJAD0111.shtml) and algorithms to model the power output of solar panels anywhere in Australia. To ensure accurate models, these theoretical data will be validated against empirical data from existing photovoltaic arrays and the modelling algorithms adjusted accordingly.

This project has been broken up in to the following tentative stages:

*   Show power output via 3D graph (release code up to here on GitHub)
*   Calculate total annual power output
*   Access empirical data from pvoutput.org
*   Tweak BOM data to use in database
*   Tweak accuracy of power output algorithm to match empirical data
*   Release public beta
*   Calculate installation costs
*   Calculate rebates and savings (based on electricity consumption patterns?)
*   Calculate break-even point
*   Release version 1

Installation
------------

You will need [Ruby on Rails 4.1](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Postgresql 9.2](http://www.postgresql.org/). Other dependencies are listed in the Gemfile. If you are not familiar with these, please read the [Rails Getting Started Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and [PostgreSQL Installation Guide](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) first. 

After you have installed the Rails dependencies and PostgreSQL, you can install Solario:

    cd to/whereever/you/want/to/install
    git clone git@github.com:studiospring/solario.git
    cd solario
    bundle install

### Security ###
Generate new hashes for secret variables in config/secrets.yml. You can use

    rake secret
to generate hashes.

### Database ###

Configure your database name and username in config/database.yml. Then run:

    rake db:migrate

Please note that database seed data is not supplied. The Irradiances.direct field is a space delimited text field that takes 180 datapoints (e.g. "3.4 4.0 4.4 ...") to generate the 3D graph. Other fields are pretty self-explanatory.

Start up your local server:

    rails server

View site at http://localhost:3000. When you have everything set up, you will want to create an admin account at http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up and add some dummy data.

Testing
-------

[Rspec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs) and [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec) are used to test this app.
To run the tests, after you have started rails, in your shell:

    bundle exec guard

Authentication/Authorisation
----------------------------

Solario has an admin section which is secured via the [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem.
