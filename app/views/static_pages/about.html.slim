    | What is Solario?
  p
    | Solario helps you decide if it is economical or not to install photovoltaic panels on your roof. It is a work-in-progress with limited functionality. At present, it uses dummy data to show the annual power output for panels of any configuration.

    | Roadmap
  p
    | The goal of Solario is to inform you of the various financial costs and benefits of installing photovoltaic panels. Ultimately, an impartial cost-benefit analysis is to be generated by using 
    a[href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/how/newproducts/IDCJAD0111.shtml"]
      | Bureau of Meteorology data
    |  and algorithms to model the power output of solar panels anywhere in Australia. To ensure accurate models, these theoretical data will be validated against empirical data from existing photovoltaic arrays and the modelling algorithms adjusted accordingly.

    | How it works
  p
    | Solario compares the financial costs and benefits of solar panels. The costs are largely market-driven and include:
  ul
    li
      | the cost of the panels and installation
    li
      | sale price of excess solar generated electricity
    li
      | government rebates
  p
    | How beneficial solar panels will be depends on:
  ul
    li
      | power generated, which depends on the amount of solar radiation captured, which in turn depends on location, panel orientation, etc
    li
      | power consumption patterns
    li
      | the cost of alternative sources of electricity
    li
      | power storage capacity
    li
      | panel lifespan
  p
    | To calculate power generation: 
  ol
    li
      | calculate the elevation and azimuth of the sun at the panel's location at regular intervals throughout the day and year
    li
      | calculate the angle of the sun from 1., relative to the panel
    li
      | collect direct and diffuse radiation values from aggregated 
      abbr[title="Bureau of Meteorology"]
        | BOM
      |  data for the corresponding location and times
    li
      | annual diffuse radiation values and direct radiation collected by the panel is calculated from the relative angle of the sun
    li
      | add radiation values and factor in efficiency to calculate annual power output
    li
      | get actual power outputs for similar panel configurations from 
      a[href="http://pvoutput.org/"]
        | pvoutput.org
    li
      | compare actual output of the existing panel from pvoutput.org with its theoretical outputs
    li
      | final theoretical output is adjusted for any discrepancies between theoretical and empirical measurements
