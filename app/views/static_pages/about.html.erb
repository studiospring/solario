  <h1>What is Solario?</h1>
  <p>Solario helps you decide if it is economical or not to install photovoltaic panels on your roof. It is a work-in-progress with limited functionality. At present, it uses dummy data to show the annual power output for panels of any configuration.</p>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>The cost-effectiveness of photovoltaic generated electricity depends on many factors, but can be broken in to two main groups. One is how much power is generated and needed: the electricity generated, rather than the solar panels, is the product being evaluated. Power supply and demand is determined by factors including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the amount of solar radiation captured, which in turn depends on location, panel orientation, etc</li>
    <li>power consumption patterns</li>
    <li>power storage</li>
    <li>panel lifespan</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The other group is the market-driven factors: the economic expenses, savings and returns. Examples of market-driven factors include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the cost of the panels and installation</li>
    <li>the cost of alternative sources of electricity</li>
    <li>sale price of excess solar generated electricity</li>
    <li>government rebates</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It should be noted that due to the nature of solar power and electricity demand, many of these factors fluctuate on an annual basis and throughout the day.</p>
  <h2>Roadmap</h2>
  <p>The goal of Solario is to inform you of the various financial costs and benefits of installing photovoltaic panels. Ultimately, an impartial cost-benefit analysis is to be generated by using <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/how/newproducts/IDCJAD0111.shtml">Bureau of Meteorology data</a> and algorithms to model the power output of solar panels anywhere in Australia. To ensure accurate models, these theoretical data will be validated against empirical data from existing photovoltaic arrays and the modelling algorithms adjusted accordingly.</p>
  <p>This project has been broken up in to the following tentative stages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Show power output via 3D graph <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></li>
    <li>Calculate total annual power output</li>
    <li>Access empirical data from <a href="http://pvoutput.org/">pvoutput.org</a></li>
    <li>Tweak <abbr title="Bureau of Meteorology">BOM</abbr> data to use in database</li>
    <li>Tweak accuracy of power output algorithm to match empirical data</li>
    <li>Release beta</li>
    <li>Calculate installation costs</li>
    <li>Calculate rebates and savings, based on electricity consumption patterns</li>
    <li>Calculate break-even point</li>
    <li>Release version 1</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tech</h2>
  <p>Some of the technology used to run Solario include:</p>
  <ul>
