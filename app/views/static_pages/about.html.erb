  <h1>What is Solario?</h1>
  <p>Solario helps you decide if it is economical or not to install photovoltaic panels on your roof. It is a work-in-progress with limited functionality. At present, it uses dummy data to show the annual power output for panels of any configuration.</p>
  <h2>Roadmap</h2>
  <p>The goal of Solario is to inform you of the various financial costs and benefits of installing photovoltaic panels. Ultimately, an impartial cost-benefit analysis is to be generated by using <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/how/newproducts/IDCJAD0111.shtml">Bureau of Meteorology data</a> and algorithms to model the power output of solar panels anywhere in Australia. To ensure accurate models, these theoretical data will be validated against empirical data from existing photovoltaic arrays and the modelling algorithms adjusted accordingly.</p>
  <p>This project has been broken up in to the following tentative stages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Show power output via 3D graph <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></li>
    <li>Calculate total annual power output <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></li>
    <li>Access empirical data from <a href="http://pvoutput.org/">pvoutput.org</a> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span></li>
    <li>Tweak <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/how/newproducts/IDCJAD0111.shtml">Bureau of Meteorology data</a> to use in database</li>
    <li>Tweak accuracy of power output algorithm to match empirical data</li>
    <li>Release public beta</li>
    <li>Calculate installation costs</li>
    <li>Calculate rebates and savings (based on electricity consumption patterns?)</li>
    <li>Calculate break-even point</li>
    <li>Release version 1</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Solario compares the financial costs and benefits of solar panels. The costs are largely market-driven and include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the cost of the panels and installation</li>
    <li>sale price of excess solar generated electricity</li>
    <li>government rebates</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How beneficial solar panels will be depends on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>power generated, which depends on the amount of solar radiation captured, which in turn depends on location, panel orientation, etc</li>
    <li>power consumption patterns</li>
    <li>the cost of alternative sources of electricity</li>
    <li>power storage capacity</li>
    <li>panel lifespan</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To calculate power generation:
  <ol>
    <li>the elevation and azimuth of the sun at the panel's location is calculated at regular intervals throughout the day and year</li>
    <li>the angle of the sun from 1., relative to the panel is calculated</li>
    <li>direct and diffuse radiation values for the corresponding location and times are collected from aggregated <abbr title="Bureau of Meteorology">BOM</abbr> data</li>
    <li>radiation collected by the panel is calculated from the relative angle of the sun and annual direct and diffuse radiation values</li>
    <li>radiation values are totaled and efficiency factored in to calculate annual power output</li>
    <li>actual power outputs for similar panel configurations are collected from <a href="http://pvoutput.org/">pvoutput.org</a></li>
    <li>theoretical outputs of the existing panel from pvoutput.org is calculated and compared to its actual output</li>
    <li>final theoretical output is adjusted for any discrepancies between theoretical and empirical measurements</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tech</h2>
